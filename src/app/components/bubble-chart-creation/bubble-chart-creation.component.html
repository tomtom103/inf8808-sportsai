                Mbappe dominates with an impressive 38 GCAs and about 70 keys passes, leading in both categories by a considerable margin with the
                likes of Nkunku.

            <p class="text-paragraph">
                It speaks volume knowing that his number of passes in the 18-yard box is an average 60. Far below Benzema's 85. Wich means with less
                activity in the box, Mpabbe can create more.
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
                At the bottom left, we find Man√© & Leao. Mane is dead last in each categories. As for Leao, he has about the same number of GCA as
                Benzema despiste being last and first respectively in PPA.
