            <p>A goal comes from a shot on target, and a shot on target comes from a shot.</p>

            <p>
                Let's look at how each player makes the most of every occasion to score. Transforming a simple shot into a goal is very hard, and
                requires a lot of calm, composure and accuracy. The best scorers are the ones who are able to focus on the moment.

                This aspect is extremely important, because it is a concrete proof that the player is able to create opportunities and exploit them.

            <p class="text-paragraph">
                Once again, Mane and Leao are left behind as only players with under 20 goals scored while having 20 to 30 more shots attempted than
                Nkunku.
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">Funny enough, Nkunku has about the same amount of shots on target than those two.</p>
